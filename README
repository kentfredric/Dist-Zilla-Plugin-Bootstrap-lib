NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::lib - A minimal boot-strapping for
    Dist::Zilla Plug-ins.

VERSION
    version 0.01000003

SYNOPSIS
        [Bootstrap::lib]

DESCRIPTION
    This module does the very simple task of injecting the distributions
    'lib' directory into @INC at the point of its inclusion, so that you can
    use plug-ins you're writing for "Dist::Zilla", to release the plug-in
    itself.

METHODS
  log_debug
    1;
  plugin_name
    'Bootstrap::lib'
  dump_config
    sub { }
  register_component
    sub { }
USE CASES
    This module really is only useful in the case where you need to use
    something like

        dzil -Ilib

    For *every* call to "Dist::Zilla", and this is mainly a convenience.

PRECAUTIONS
  DO NOT
    DO NOT use this library from inside a bundle. It will not likely work as
    expected, and you DO NOT want to bootstrap everything in all cases.

  NO VERSION
    At present, using this module in conjunction with a module with no
    explicitly defined version in the source will result in the *executed*
    instance of that plug-in *also* having NO VERSION.

    This may have a workaround in the future, but no guarantees.

  NOT REALLY A PLUG-IN
    This is really just an inglorious hack masquerading as a plug-in. In
    order to be useful for *all* plug-ins that you may want to normally use
    with "Dist::Zilla", we subvert the entire plug-in system and do all our
    work during "require".

  GOOD LUCK
    I wrote this plug-in, mostly because I was boiler-plating the code into
    every dist I had that needed it, and it became annoying, especially
    having to update the code across distributions to handle "Dist::Zilla"
    "API" changes.
